  <!-- Project 1: Automated Inventory Management using LLM -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>Automated Inventory Management using LLM</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, I developed a system to automate the inventory management process using a Large Language Model (LLM). 
      The system classified customer emails into different categories by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and leveraging LLMs. 
      It extracted important order features from these emails using Python regex and updated the inventory accordingly. 
      Additionally, I created custom responses for customer email queries by integrating a document-based retrieval system, 
      ensuring fast and accurate replies tailored to each customer's needs.

  <!-- Project 2: Floor Plan Generation using Generative AI -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>Floor Plan Generation using Generative AI</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved leveraging generative AI techniques to create multi-story floor plans using the Stable Diffusion Model. 
      The research was based on preexisting studies but expanded to enhance accuracy and model efficiency. 
      By generating custom datasets using the CLIP model, the team fine-tuned the model for more precise floor plan generation. 
      This approach allowed us to create highly accurate and detailed architectural layouts, improving on past methodologies in the field.

  <!-- Project 3: Clothes Re-selling Website – Sycle -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>Clothes Re-selling Website – Sycle</h2>
    <p>
      "Sycle" is a clothing re-selling web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). 
      I collaborated on this project by utilizing TypeScript, Material-UI (MUI), and Figma for front-end design and development. 
      On the back-end, Node.js and Express handled server logic, while Mongoose was used for database management. 
      The platform connects sellers and buyers, promoting sustainability through recycling. 
      I also managed version control using Git, ensuring smooth collaboration among the team and efficient implementation of the system.

  <!-- Project 4: Data Mining and Analysis -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>Data Mining and Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout this project, I completed multiple tasks on Kaggle, focusing on classification, clustering, regression, and text analysis. 
      Using powerful Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and NLTK, I applied various machine learning algorithms to perform in-depth analysis. 
      Techniques like feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning were employed to optimize performance. 
      By analyzing and visualizing datasets using Matplotlib and Seaborn, I successfully uncovered hidden patterns and trends within the data.

  <!-- Project 5: Painting Store Web-Based Inventory -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>Painting Store Web-Based Inventory</h2>
    <p>
      I developed a web application for an art dealership management system, focusing on creating an efficient web-based inventory. 
      The application was built using SQL for database management and emphasized data science principles for smooth data handling. 
      The database was designed and implemented using Oracle SQL, allowing for the efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. 
      Additionally, I used JAVA and OJDBC to seamlessly connect the database, while the front-end was developed with HTML and CSS to provide an intuitive user interface.

  <!-- Project 6: Computer Vision-Based Volume Control Remote -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>Computer Vision-Based Volume Control Remote</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, I developed a motion-sensing remote that adjusts the volume based on hand gestures. 
      The system uses machine learning algorithms to recognize gestures in real-time, allowing users to control volume without physical buttons. 
      Python libraries like OpenCV and NumPy were utilized for processing and interpreting gesture data. 
      The system successfully recognized a variety of gestures and adjusted volume accordingly, providing an innovative and intuitive user experience.

  <!-- Project 7: Student Budgeting Android App – Wallit -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>Student Budgeting Android App – Wallit</h2>
    <p>
      "Wallit" is an Android app designed to help young people improve their financial literacy. Leading a team of three, 
      I worked on this project to develop an intuitive app that tracks daily spending across different categories and includes a to-do list for task management. 
      The UI was designed using Figma, while the app itself was developed in JAVA using Android Studio. 
      The app was rigorously tested using Junit to ensure reliability and performance. By helping users manage their finances, 
      "Wallit" promotes better budgeting habits among its target audience.

  <!-- Project 8: End-to-End RAG Based Chatbot -->
  <div class="project-card">
    <h2>End-to-End RAG Based Chatbot</h2>
    <p>
      This project involved developing a fully functional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot. 
      The system was built using LANGCHAIN and Gorq Fast API, combining advanced natural language understanding with the ability to retrieve specific documents from a database to generate responses. 
      I also created the front-end for the chatbot using Python’s Streamlit, providing an intuitive and responsive interface. 
      The end-to-end system demonstrates the potential of RAG for real-world applications like customer service and personal assistants.
